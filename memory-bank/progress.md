# Progress

## Current Status
The Python Doom project is in the initial development phase. The Memory Bank documentation has been set up to define the project scope, architecture, and technical approach. Implementation of the actual game code is about to begin, starting with the core raycasting engine.

## What Works
- Project planning: Memory Bank documentation completed
- Research: Raycasting algorithms and implementation approaches identified
- Reference code: Existing Pygame implementation (Space Invaders) available for reference

## In Progress
- Core raycasting engine: Beginning implementation of the basic rendering system
- Project structure: Setting up the initial file organization and component structure

## What's Left to Build
- Raycasting Engine: Core rendering system for 3D-like environment
- Map System: Level layout and environment representation
- Player Controller: Movement, rotation, and interaction mechanics
- Collision Detection: Wall and object collision handling
- Enemy AI: Different enemy types with varying behaviors
- Weapon System: Multiple weapons with different characteristics
- Combat Mechanics: Shooting, damage calculation, and hit detection
- Sound System: Sound effects and background music
- User Interface: HUD, menus, and game state displays
- Level Progression: Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Game State Management: Saving/loading, pause functionality, etc.

## Known Issues
- No implementation issues yet as development is just beginning

## Testing Status
- No formal testing implemented yet
- Manual testing will be used during initial development

## Recent Milestones
- Project initialization: Memory Bank documentation created
- Architecture defined: Component structure and relationships established

## Upcoming Milestones
- Basic raycasting engine implementation: Target - 1 week
- Player movement and collision: Target - 2 weeks
- First playable level: Target - 3 weeks
- Enemy implementation: Target - 4 weeks
- Complete game with multiple levels: Target - 8 weeks
