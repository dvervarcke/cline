# Product Context

## Purpose
The Python Doom implementation exists to recreate the classic first-person shooter experience in a modern, accessible Python environment. It serves as both a tribute to the iconic game and a demonstration of game development techniques using Python and Pygame.

## Problem Statement
Many classic games like Doom are becoming less accessible on modern systems, and understanding their technical implementation can be challenging. This Python implementation aims to solve this by providing a cross-platform, open-source version that is both playable and educational, allowing users to enjoy the game while potentially learning about game development concepts.

## Target Users
- Retro Gaming Enthusiasts: Players who enjoy classic games and want to experience Doom on modern systems
- Game Development Students: Those learning about game development concepts, particularly raycasting and game AI
- Python Developers: Programmers interested in seeing complex game mechanics implemented in Python
- Doom Fans: Players who have nostalgia for the original game and want to experience a reimagined version

## User Journeys
1. Casual Gaming Experience
   - Launch the game
   - Navigate through levels
   - Combat enemies
   - Complete objectives
   - Experience the classic Doom atmosphere

2. Educational Journey
   - Examine the source code to understand raycasting implementation
   - Study the game mechanics and AI behavior
   - Potentially modify or extend the game
   - Learn about game development patterns and techniques

## User Experience Goals
