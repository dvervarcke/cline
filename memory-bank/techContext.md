# Technical Context

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: Pygame for rendering, input handling, and window management
- Backend: Python for game logic, AI, and physics
- Database: Simple file-based storage for game settings and save states
- Infrastructure: Cross-platform Python application

## Development Environment
- IDE/Editor: Any Python-compatible editor (VSCode recommended with Python extensions)
- Local Setup: Python 3.8+ and Pygame 2.0+ installation
- Build Process: No compilation needed; runs as interpreted Python code
- Testing Framework: Manual testing for gameplay; pytest for unit testing core components

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+: Core programming language
- Pygame 2.0+: Game development library for Python
- NumPy (optional): For optimized mathematical operations
- PyInstaller (optional): For creating standalone executables

## API Integrations
- No external API integrations required

## Technical Constraints
- Performance: Python's interpreted nature limits computational performance
- Rendering: Pygame's 2D rendering capabilities require custom raycasting for 3D-like visuals
- Audio: Limited to Pygame's audio capabilities
- Physics: Simplified collision detection and physics for performance reasons

## Performance Requirements
- Frame Rate: Minimum 30 FPS on standard hardware
- Response Time: Input lag under 50ms for responsive controls
- Loading Time: Level loading under 3 seconds

## Security Considerations
- File System Access: Limited to game directory for saves and settings
- No network connectivity required

## Deployment Pipeline
The game is distributed as either Python source code or as standalone executables created with PyInstaller:

1. Development: Code changes in Python source files
2. Testing: Manual gameplay testing and unit tests
3. Packaging: (Optional) Creating standalone executables with PyInstaller
4. Distribution: Sharing via GitHub or similar platforms

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Raycasting Implementation: Based on simplified DDA (Digital Differential Analysis) algorithm
- Texture Mapping: Uses Pygame's surface capabilities for wall textures
- Sprite Rendering: Distance-sorted sprites for correct depth rendering
- Collision Detection: Grid-based collision system using the map layout
- Input Handling: Pygame event system for keyboard and mouse input
