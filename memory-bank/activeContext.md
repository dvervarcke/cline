# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on implementing the core raycasting engine for the Python Doom project. This involves creating the fundamental rendering system that will create the 3D-like environment from a 2D map, which is essential for the first-person perspective of the game.

## Recent Changes
- Initial project setup: Created project structure and Memory Bank documentation
- Research phase: Studied raycasting algorithms and Pygame capabilities
- Reference implementation: Analyzed existing Python game implementations (Space Invaders) for Pygame patterns

## Active Decisions
- Raycasting approach: Using DDA (Digital Differential Analysis) algorithm for efficient ray calculations
- Map representation: Using a 2D grid with numeric values to represent different wall types
- Rendering strategy: Implementing texture mapping for walls with distance-based shading
- Player movement: WASD keys for movement with mouse for looking/aiming

## Current Challenges
- Performance optimization: Ensuring the raycasting engine runs efficiently in Python
- Texture mapping: Implementing proper texture coordinates and perspective correction
- Sprite rendering: Determining the best approach for rendering enemies and objects
- Collision detection: Creating an accurate but efficient collision system

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic raycasting engine for rendering walls
2. Add texture mapping to walls
3. Implement player movement and collision detection
4. Create a simple level/map system
5. Add basic enemy sprites and rendering
6. Implement weapon system and combat mechanics
7. Add sound effects and basic music
8. Create multiple levels with increasing difficulty

## Open Questions
- What is the optimal grid size for the map to balance detail and performance?
- How should enemy AI be structured to provide challenging but fair gameplay?
- What level of physics simulation is necessary for an authentic experience?
- How can we optimize the rendering for consistent performance?

## Current Priorities
1. Core raycasting engine implementation
2. Player movement and controls
3. Basic level rendering
4. Collision detection

## Recent Feedback
- Project initiated: Beginning implementation of the Python Doom game
